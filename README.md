  # Portfolio
  
  ## Description 
  This project was to create a porfolio website with React.js. the website is only one page but it has conditional rendering to pull up different information. there is an about section, a portfolio section, a contact section, and a resume section that includes a download button to download a resume. the website is deployed on netlify.com. In the future I plan on adding more things to my portfolio section as well as letting the contact section actually send me an email.
